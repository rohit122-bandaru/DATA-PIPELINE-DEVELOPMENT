# DESCRIPTION

For Task 1 of the CodTech Data Science Internship, we performed the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Google Colab for a smooth, cloud-based coding experience. The tools and libraries used include Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for preprocessing and modeling, and Matplotlib/Seaborn (optional) for visual analysis.

We started by importing and exploring the Titanic dataset. Missing values were handled using median and mode imputation. New features like FamilySize and IsAlone were created to improve model performance. Categorical features were encoded using OneHotEncoder, and numerical ones were standardized with StandardScaler. A complete pipeline was built using ColumnTransformer and Pipeline, and models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier were used. Accuracy was evaluated using accuracy_score, and the pipeline provided a structured and automated way to clean, transform, and train the dataset for classification.
